# Page Structure in A4Doks

Every A4Doks page is intuitively divided into two primary sections:

**Main Content Area**: This is where the bulk of your documentation resides. It's the primary focus when readers visit a page.

**Right Panel - "On this page"**: This dedicated section provides quick links to various subsections within the main content area.

## "On this page" Auto-Parsing

A4Doks automatically populates the "On this page" section by scanning for lines in your Markdown content that start with `##`. These lines are considered as subsection headers and are listed in the right panel for quick access.

**Note**: To ensure accurate parsing and display in the "On this page" section, consistently use `##` for subsection headers in your Markdown files.

Thank you for keeping these structures in mind as you develop content with A4Doks. It ensures a harmonized and user-friendly documentation experience.
