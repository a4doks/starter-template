# Navigation and Meta Information in A4Doks

In A4Doks, the top section of each markdown file plays a crucial role in determining how pages are presented and navigated. It ensures a consistent and organized appearance for all documentation content.

## Explanation of Each Field

### `title`

- **Purpose**: Represents the main title of the page.
- **Usage**: Helps set the browser tab name (as part of meta tags) and is also used as the main heading on the page.
- **Example**: If your page is an introduction, the title might be "Welcome".

### `description`

- **Purpose**: Provides a brief summary of the page's content.
- **Usage**: Helps in setting a description meta tag for SEO purposes. It may also be displayed as a subtitle on some templates.
- **Example**: For an introductory page, the description could be "Welcome to A4Doks".

### `section-number`

- **Purpose**: Determines the order in which the main sections appear on the left navigation panel.
- **Usage**: Sections are ordered numerically. If you want a specific page to be the first main section, you would use `section-number: 1`.
- **Note**: This determines the "parent" ordering.

### `subsection-number`

- **Purpose**: Specifies the order of subsections or child pages within a main section.
- **Usage**: If you have multiple pages under a main section, this will order them. For the first subsection under a main section, you'd use `subsection-number: 1`.
- **Note**: This determines the "child" ordering within a given section.

## Example Usage

Consider you're creating an introduction page and you want it to be the first main section with no subsections:

```markdown
---
title: Welcome
description: Welcome to A4Doks
section-number: 1
subsection-number: 1
---
```
